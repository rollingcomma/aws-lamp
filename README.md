### Purposes
This project is for an assignment from BCIT business communication course.

It can serve as a notebook to ourself as well as an entrance level guidance for new web developing beginners.

Thus we assume our main target audience have general ideal of web development, such as the popular technologies, and terms.

The third is drawing the dimension that we plan to dig into our subject vertically and horizontally, since each sub topic can be expanded as a whole project if we go deep enough.
